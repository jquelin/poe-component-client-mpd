=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements the specific types used by the distribution, and
exports them. It is using L<Sub::Exporter> underneath, so you can use
all the shenanigans to change the export names.

Current types defined and exported:

=over 4

=item * C<Cooking> - a simple enum to know what to do about that data

=over 4

=item * C<raw> - data should not be touched

=item * C<as_items> - data is to be transformed as L<Audio::MPD::Common::Item>

=item * C<as_kv> - data is to be cooked as key/values (hash)

=item * C<strip_first> - data should have its first field stripped

=back


=item * C<Transform> - a simple enum to know what to do about the data,
B<after> it has been cooked. Possible values are:

=over 4

=item * C<as_scalar> - return the first element instead of the full list

=item * C<as_stats> - transform the data from key/value to
C<Audio::MPD::Common::Stats>

=item * C<as_status> - transform the data from key/value to
C<Audio::MPD::Common::Status>
