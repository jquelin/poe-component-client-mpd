# -- attributes

=attr host

The hostname where MPD is running. Defaults to environment var
C<MPD_HOST>, then to 'localhost'. Note that C<MPD_HOST> can be of
the form C<password@host:port> (each of C<password@> or C<:port> can
be omitted).

=attr port

The port that MPD server listens to. Defaults to environment var
C<MPD_PORT>, then to parsed C<MPD_HOST> (cf above), then to 6600.

=attr password

The password to access special MPD functions. Defaults to environment
var C<MPD_PASSWORD>, then to parsed C<MPD_HOST> (cf above), then to
empty string.

=attr alias

A string to alias the newly created POE session. Defaults to C<mpd>.

=attr status_msgs_to

A session (name or id) to whom to send connection status to. Optional,
although recommended. No default. When this is done, pococm will send
*additional* events to the session, such as: C<mpd_connected> when
pococm is connected, C<mpd_disconnected> when pococm is disconnected,
etc. You thus need to register some handlers for those events.

=event MPD-related events

The goal of a POCOCM session is to drive a remote MPD server. This can
be achieved by a lot of events. Due to their sheer number, they have
been regrouped logically in modules.

However, note that to use those events, you need to send them to the
POCOCM session that you created with C<spawn()> (see above). Indeed, the
logical split is only internal: you are to use the same peer.


For a list of public events that update and/or query MPD, see embedded
pod in:

=over 4

=item * L<POE::Component::Client::MPD::Commands> for general commands

=item * L<POE::Component::Client::MPD::Playlist> for playlist-related
commands. Those events begin with C<pl.>.

=item * L<POE::Component::Client::MPD::Collection> for collection-
related commands. Those events begin with C<coll.>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use POE qw{ Component::Client::MPD };
    POE::Component::Client::MPD->spawn( {
        host           => 'localhost',
        port           => 6600,
        password       => 's3kr3t',  # mpd password
        alias          => 'mpd',     # poe alias
        status_msgs_to => 'myapp',   # session to send status info to
    } );

    # ... later on ...
    $_[KERNEL]->post( mpd => 'next' );



=head1 DESCRIPTION

POCOCM gives a clear message-passing interface (sitting on top of POE)
for talking to and controlling MPD (Music Player Daemon) servers. A
connection to the MPD server is established as soon as a new POCOCM
object is created.

Commands are then sent to the server as messages are passed.



=head1 EVENTS FIRED

A POCOCM session will fire events, either to answer an incoming event,
or to inform about some changes regarding the remote MPD server.


=head2 Answer events

For each incoming event received by the POCOCM session, it will fire
back one of the following answers:


=over 4

=item * mpd_result( $msg, $answer )

Indicates a success. C<$msg> is a
L<POE::Component::Client::MPD::Message> object with the original
request, to identify the issued command (see
L<POE::Component::Client::MPD::Message> pod for more information). Its
C<status()> attribute is true, further confirming success.


C<$answer> is what has been answered by the MPD server. Depending on the
command, it can be either:

=over 4

=item * C<undef>: commands C<play>, etc.

=item * an L<Audio::MPD::Common::Stats> object: command C<stats>

=item * an L<Audio::MPD::Common::Status> object: command C<status>

=item * an L<Audio::MPD::Common::Item> object: commands C<song>, etc.

=item * an array reference: commands C<coll.files>, etc.

=item * etc.

=back

Refer to the documentation of each event to know what type of answer you
can expect.


=item * mpd_error( $msg, $errstr )

Indicates a failure. C<$msg> is a
L<POE::Component::Client::MPD::Message> object with the original
request, to identify the issued command (see
L<POE::Component::Client::MPD::Message> pod for more information). Its
C<status()> attribute is false, further confirming failure.


C<$errstr> is what the error message as returned been answered by the
MPD server.


=back



=head2 Auto-generated events

If you supplied the C<status_msgs_to> attribute, the following events
are fired to this peer by pococm:

=over 4

=item * mpd_connect_error( $reason )

Called when pococm-conn could not connect to a mpd server. It can be
either retriable, or fatal. Check C<$reason> for more information.


=item * mpd_connected( )

Called when pococm-conn made sure we're talking to a mpd server.


=item * mpd_disconnected( )

Called when pococm-conn has been disconnected from mpd server.

=back
